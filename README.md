# User Search Application

This is a React application that allows users to search for other users by their name. The app demonstrates the use of API interactions using `RTK Query`, component-based architecture, and testing with `Jest` and `React Testing Library`.

## Features

- **User Search**: Users can search for other users by entering a name and clicking the search button.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if no users are found or if the API request fails.
- **UI Components**: Reusable components like `TextField`, `Button`, and `UserList`.
- **Tests**: Unit tests written with **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure components function correctly.
